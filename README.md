# 08 TypeScript and OOP: Vehicle Builder

## Description
```
A command line app that uses the npm install and node packages. 
My project is a fun app that uses the integrated terminal/command line interface.
Using TS (Type Script) and package installals I was able to create an interactive application that prompts the user to answer questions. 
The user answers prompts to create a vehicle. 
The user is prompted to choose a Color. 
Then make, model, etc. 
After the user chooses their color, make, model, weight, top speed, towing capacity, tire brand, wheels etc. 
Then they are able to "start, control the Vehicle (accelerate, decelerate, stop, turn left or right, reverse or tow).
After answering the prompts the user can  print details of the vehicle(s) they assembled.
A final prompt will then ask the user if they would like to "Exit" or " Select or create another vehicle."
